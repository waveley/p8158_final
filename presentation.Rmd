## Motivation

- The onset of COVID-19 affected almost every sphere of work and leisure.

- We are interested in investigating the impact athletic identity may have on athletes' overall well-being, particularly as the context of a global pandemic may have dramatically impacted one's experience of playing a sport/being an athlete.

## Resilience, Healthy Lifestyle, and Mental Health

- Resilience and healthy lifestyle are both characteristics that are associated with improved mental health. 

- These are also characteristics that are usually associated with professional athletes.

- We hypothesize that the effect that being a devoted athlete has on overall well-being would be mediated through these two characteristics, and will endeavor to investigate the relationships between these variables as well.

## Methodology

1. Conduct EFA and CFA to determine which observed variables underlie our latent variables of interest.
2. Evaluate reliability of the determined latent structures with Chronbach's alpha.
2. Construct SEM(s) to quantify the relationship between our constructed latent variables and mental health score.

## Data: Athlete Mental Health Survey

The dataset we selected contains responses for several surveys administered in the UK to assess athlete (and non-athlete) mental health and well-being after the country's first COVID-19 lockdown.

These surveys include:

- Athletic Identity Scale (AIMS)

- The Brief Resilience Scale

- Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF)

In total, 753 individuals were interviewed -- we will focus our analysis on the 363 athletes represented in this study. 

## Latent Variable 1: Athletic Identity

![Athletic Identity Scale (AIMS)](images/aims_annotated.jpg)

## Latent Variable 1 (Athletic Identity): EFA

After conducting EFA, we first propose that there are three latent variables underlying the AIMS variables, structured as follows:

- `external_identity` (comprised of `sprt_goals`, `cnsdr_ath`, `frnds_ath`)
- `internal_value` (comprised of `sprt_impt`, `think_sprt`)
- `negative_events` (comprised of `dprs_sprt`, `bad_sprt`)

## Latent Variable 1 (Athletic Identity): Reliability

Chronbach's alphas were reasonable for `internal_value` and `negative_events` (0.81 and 0.63, respectively). No variables indicated that could be dropped to improve reliability for either latent variable.

However, for `external_identity`:

Since Chronbach's alpha for `external_identity` would improve significantly if `frnds_ath` is removed, we decided to remove this variable from the latent structure.

## Latent Variable 1 (Athletic Identity): CFA

We hypothesized that there exists a second-order latent variable, `athletic_identity`, underlying the latent variables `external_identity`, `internal_value`, and `negative_events`. Conducting a CFA allows us to evaluate this hypothesis:

\centering
![](images/athletic_identity_cfa.png)

Fit statistics: CFI > 0.99, RMSEA < 0.05, $\chi^2$ = 0.514
<!--Both the first- and second- order latent variables report significant loadings. As fit statistics are also adequate (CFA > 0.99, RMSEA < 0.05, $\chi^2$ = 0.514), we will proceed with this structure in our SEM. -->

## Latent Variable 2: Resilience

## Latent Variable 2 (Resilience): EFA

After running EFA on 1- and 2- factor models, we find that the 1-factor model, containing all variables from the scale fits the best.

## Latent Variable 2 (Resilience): Reliability

\centering
![](images/resilience_reliability.png)

<!--No items can be dropped to improve this measure, so we will keep all of them in this latent variable.-->

## Latent Variable 2 (Resilience): CFA

\centering
![](images/resilience_cfa.png)

Fit statistics: CFI > 0.98, RMSEA < 0.08, $\chi^2$ = 0.017
<!--Loadings are all significant. As fit statistics are adequate (CFI > 0.98, RMSEA < 0.08, though $\chi^2$ = 0.017), we will proceed with this structure in our SEM.-->

## Latent Variable 3: Healthy Lifestyle

We hypothesized that we could create a latent variable representing a healthy lifestyle using the following variables:

- `fruit_veg`: Five Fruit and Vegetables (Yes/No)

- `smoking`: Smoking Status (7-point Likert scale)

- `hr_sleep`: Hour Sleep (numeric variable)


## Latent Variable 3 (Healthy Lifestyle): Reliability

\centering
![](images/health_alpha.png)

## Latent Variable 3: Healthy Lifestyle

Chronbach's alpha is very low for these variables, indicating that the variables `hr_sleep`, `smoking`, `fruit_veg` do not reliably measure the latent variable. 

Since `healthy_lifestyle` is thus not reliably measured with these variables, we made the decision to exclude this latent variable from SEM analysis -- treating this latent variable as a formative (rather than a reflective) construct might more accurately reflect its nature.

## Outcome Variable: Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF)

\centering
![Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF)](images/mhc_sf.jpg)

## Outcome Variable: MHC-SF

Three components of well-being are assessed:

- Emotional
- Social
- Psychological

We will use the MHC-SF composite score (sum of all responses) as our outcome variable. Higher scores indicate greater levels of positive well-being.

## SEM 1: Athletic Identity and MHC-SF 

<!--First, we constructed a SEM relating athletic identity to MHC-SF score, without any mediating variable.-->

\centering
![](images/SEM_1.png)

## SEM 1: Direct Effect

We found that though the estimated effect between athletic identity and MHC-SF score is negative, indicating that a stronger athletic identity decreases overall well-being, the p-value associated with this value is 0.232.

Therefore, we conclude that there is **no** significant relationships between athletic identity and overall well-being.

## SEM 2: Resilience, Athletic Identity, and MHC-SF

<!--We constructed another SEM to investigate the mediation effect of resilience on the relationship between athletic identity and MHC-SF score.-->

\centering
![](images/SEM_2.png)

## SEM 2: Direct Effects

The estimated direct effect between resilience and MHC-SF is positive and statistically significant (p-value > 0.05), indicating that greater resilience increases overall well-being.

We found that estimated direct effect between athletic identity and resilience is negative, indicating that stronger athletic identity decreases resilience. However, this effect was again indicated to **not** be significant. 

## SEM 2: Indirect Effect

\centering
![](images/standardized_direct_indirect.png)

<!--The indirect effect of athletic identity on MHC-SF through its effect on resilience is -0.056. This indicates that a 0.39 unit increase in resilience leads to a 0.056 unit decrease in MHC-SF.

As the p-values are both > 0.05, both the total and indirect effect of athletic identity are not significant -->

## SEM 3: Comparison of Athletes and Non-Athletes

We were interested in seeing if there are differences in the effects of athletic identity, resilience, and MCH-SF score between athletes and non-athletes. 

To do so, we will construct two SEMs, with unstandardized coefficients, to compare these two groups.


## SEM 3: Comparison of Athletes and Non-Athletes

Note: diagrams simplified for readability.

## SEM 3: Results

We found that there is a significant estimated effect between athletic identity and MHC-SF in non-athletes.

- Direct/Indirect effect of athletic identity among athletes
![indirect_effect](images/athlete_unstandardized_direct_indirect.png)

- Direct/Indirect effect of athletic identity among non-athletes
![indirect_effect](images/non_athlete_unstandardized_direct_indirect.png)

## SEM: Conclusion

Athletic identity was not found to be significantly associated with overall well-being for athletes in either model.

Resilience was significantly related to overall well-being for both athletes and non-athletes.

- This characteristic had a higher impact on overall well-being in non-athletes than it did in athletes.

- Also had a greater effect on overall well-being than athletic identity, in general.

Athletic identity had a significant negative direct effect on overall well-being for non-athletes, about 2.5 times the magnitude of the corresponding effect for athletes.

## Discussion

Given the context of this survey, a lack of access to one's sport is a possible explanation for the negative effect athletic identity seems to have produced on overall well-being. 

The differences in direct effects between athletic identity and overall well-being between athletes and non-athletes is difficult to account for

- Perhaps one possible explanation for the well-being of non-athletes being affected far more than the well-being of athletes is that though COVID-19 made playing a sport different/difficult, athletes may have had more resources at their disposal (i.e., support from coaches, other athletic professionals, etc.)

Our findings for resilience as a trait that is positively associated with mental health and overall well-being agrees with previous research. 

## Limitations and Recommendations for Future Study

The results of this study should be applied with caution -- while making efforts to bolster one's resilience may be something to consider, some exercises to do so may be dangerous. 

We were unable to represent healthy lifestyle as a reflective latent variable using the observed variables we had available. Future research could:

- Consider constructing formative latent variable

- Collect more data measuring this variable to be used in the model
