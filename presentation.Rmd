## Motivation

## Goal

## Data 
- Athlete Mental Healthy Survey collected in the UK after the first COVID-19 lockdown using non-athletes as comparison
- Focus on athletic identity, resilience, wellbeing, and healthy lifestyle
- Athletic Identity Scale, The Brief Resilience Scale, The Mental Health Continuum Short Form
- 753 Observations (363 athletes, 390 non-athletes) 

## Athletic Identity Scale (AIMS)
- Abbreviated 7-item AIMS$^1$

![](data/AIMS.png)

- First-order factors (Social Identity, Exclusivity, Negative Affectivity) are subordinated to a higher-order Athletic Identity Factor

## AIMS (Continued)
- Result of the confirmatory factor analysis of AMIS with athletes in data
- (insert CFA graph)
- Chronbach's alpha is 0.74, with a 95 \% confidence interval of (0.70, 0.78).

## The Brief Resilience Scale
- Assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress$^2$

## The Brief Resilience Scale (Continued)
- Positive Polarity Factor: BRS1, BRS3, BRS5$^3$
- Chronbach's alpha is 0.74, with a 95 \% confidence interval of (0.71, 0.80)
- Negative Polarity Factor: BRS2, BRS4, BRS6$^3$
- Chronbach's alpha is 0.86, with a 95 \% confidence interval of (0.84, 0.88)
- (CFA? pick either positive or negative?)

## The Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF)
- Assess three components of well-being: emotional, social, and psychological$^4$
- Total score ranging from 0 to 70
- Higher scores indicate greater levels of positive well-being
- Total sum score of MHC-SF is negatively correlated to mental illness and negative effect
